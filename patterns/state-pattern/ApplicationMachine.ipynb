    "# Application State Machine\n",
    "We're going to build a state machine to handle applications. The basic flow and constrains of a application is as below:\n",
    "1. Application has following attributes:\n",
    "  - `General information`, such as application's owner info, terms, etc.\n",
    "  - `Signatures`, a set of signatures of owners', witness, etc.\n",
    "  - `Expiry Date`, when application to be expired\n",
    "  - `Payment info`, info relating to payment process\n",
    "  - `Underwriting info`, info relating to underwriting process\n",
    "2. Possible actions:\n",
    "  - `update`, update `general information` of the application\n",
    "  - `sign`, sign the application, update `Signatures`\n",
    "  - `underwriting`, send the application through underwriting process\n",
    "  - `pay`, send the application through payment process\n",
    "  - `submit`, submit the final application\n",

    "    - **Removing the `input` is not a good idea** since it's not consistent with other combination and further more, we will need branching in our state machine to check whether we need to invoke the machine with or without `input`.\n",
    "    - Another possible solution is to **pass an empty `ApplicationModel`**, this works and is awkward.\n",
    "    - The most suitable solution is to **create a new `input` class**, maybe just a dummy one, just for the sake of distinguish different kind of `input`. We also need to create another `input` class to represent the `underwriting` result. \n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "We have finished implement a simplified version of a state machine to control Application's state. Regardless of its simplicity, we have covered most of potential scenarios and identified some paint points (where multiple options are available) in this machine. This allow us to further enhance the machine as more use cases to be requested. Below are primary components:\n",
    "1. The `ApplicationMachine` is our main working horse, centralized control that piercing all the piece together.\n",
    "2. The `State` subclasses, representing all possible states of an application. So far, we got: `Draft`, `Signed`, `Underwriting`, `Underwritten`, `Payment_Pending`, `Payment_Failed`, `Payment_Success`, `Submitted`.<br>\n",
    "   Each of these states will handle its own operation via `_enter_action` and `_exit_action`. None of them are aware of the other states, making them **independent and decoupling** from each other.\n",
    "3. The `Input` classes define different type of inputs, making the `state_table` more expressive and specific.\n",
    "4. The `Predicates` classes define conditional logic to offer validations, flow controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Further enhancement\n",
    "1. The only component we haven't standardized is `event`. We're using string to identify different event. This could be organized with an `Enum` class.\n",
    "2. The `state_table` is quite primitive. We could also standadized the table format with `namedtuple` or a dedicated class.\n",
    "3. Generalizing the `StateMachine` so it could be used for different kind of object. As long as we define all related components, i.e. `State`, `Input`, `Predicates`, and respective `state_table`.\n",
    "4. The handling of missing State, Predicate reject/acceptance would also be further enhanced\n",
    "5. One major area we definitely need to look into is how consistent our machine is, i.e. what is the posibility it would leave the obj in invalid state?"
