    "So far, we have created following classes:\n",
    "1. The `Door` class that represents `door` objects, doing nothing except providing method to change its own state.\n",
    "2. The `StateMachine` which handles `event` to update `door`'s state based on `state_table`\n",
    "3. The `state_table` defines a mapping between a combination of `event` and `current_state` to a `target_state`, along with a set of `predicates` that will validate the input before actually updating `door` state.\n",
    "4. The `Predicate` class which defines a template for `predicates` with `check` method. The logic to validate the `input` will be encapsulated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of thing to improve:\n",
    "1. We only change the `door` state's label, there should be some activity going along with each particular state that we haven't implemented yet. We also haven't implemented a proper `State` class which handles these logic.\n",
    "2. There's 2 approaches:\n",
    "  - treats `Door` as `data class` which will have only methods to retrive/write data (with fundamental data validation such as min/max, empty/null values). Then, other business logic will be handled by the `StateMachine` and `State` class. `door` object will be passed around and manupulated accordingly.\n",
    "  - Reusability:\n",
    "    - `StateMachine` can be reused, given that we define a different `state_table` and move all business logic to `State` subclass.\n",
    "    - `State` class is always reusable since it's only an interface. Business logic needs to reside in its subclass to cater different states of `door` object. If there is new object, such as a `VendorMachine`, we need to write new subclass.\n",
    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    - We can not encapsulate all activity of `Door` inside itself, make it more difficult to understand what a `Door` should do.\n",
    "    - There's tight coupling between the `State` subclass and `door`'s internal. So, if the `door`'s internal changes, we need to update all `State` subclass accordingly.<br>\n",
    "      A way to reduce this coupling is for the `Door` class implements and exposes all necessary methods to allow `State` works with `door` object instead of directly manipulating `door`'s internal attributes."

    "1. `set_state` and `get_state`, initialize `states` which is a dict that stores available states.\n",
    "2. Delegate `open`, `close`, `lock`, `unlock` to appropriate `State` subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyze:\n",
    "1. State-specific behaviors are encapsulated within its appropriate `State` subclass.\n",
    "2. `State` base class provide a default implementation for all behavior which is a simple prompt and does nothing to the door. This could be replaced with an Exception if required. Subclass only needs to implement behaviors that are allowed in subclass's `state`, using the default implementation provided by base class `State` for other behaviors.\n",
    "3. We have 4 new classes now. Changing behavior of a particular `state`, however, is simple.\n",
    "4. Though, if there's new state, it will require more work since the states are slightly **coupling to each others** due to the fact that state transitions are also handled by state subclasses.<br>\n",
    "`OpenedState` knows about `ClosedState` so upon `close()` the door, it could do:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class OpenedState(State):\n",

    "        door.set_state(\"Closed\")\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there's a new mediate state between `Opened` and `Closed`, say `PartiallyClosed`. We need to modify `OpenedState` class to update the transition (from `Opened -> Closed` to `Opened -> PartiallyClosed`, and we may also need to add new transition `Closed -> PartiallyClosed`.<br>\n",
    "We will look at a different implementation using `table-driven` approach later.\n",
    "5. Since the **transition logic is scattered** throughout subclasses, it's difficult to have a full picture of what's really going on, especially if we have more states and more behaviors.\n",
    "6. Again, the transition between states in this example is quite simple, it still lacks some side-effect that a real-life scenario would have, such as making a sound as door is open, updating the record of how many times door was opened/closed, keep tabs or duration by which door is closed/opened/locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicate and Input\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful feature of a state machine has not being touched is the use of `Predicate` or a `Guarded Transition`. This allow the door to handle more complex scenarios based on various additional `inputs` we could provide, such as:\n",
    "- whether the person is authorized to open the door. The `input` in this case could be the person's id provided by a card reader, finger print scanner, eye scanner or face recognition.\n",
    "- A surveillance camera that could tell whether the person is tailgated that result in door won't be opened.\n",
    "- With thermometers, such camera could also tell whether the person is sick via body temperature to determine if this person is allowed to enter\n",
    "We should be able to implement all of this feature without the `State Pattern` but you could imagine how complex and maybe confused your code could become with all of these logic.\n",

    "*Note*: You might want to use `InputClass` or even `EventClass` instead of a pre-instantiated object to define transitions to make it usable for different `input` of the same type (same class). You could also use a base class to have more variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, with any given combination of `event`, `input`, `current_state`, we can form a `tuple` with which we look up `state_table` to retrieve corresponding `target_state`, `transition`, and `predicates` then finally execute them in following order:\n",
    "1. Check/validate `input` by running `predicates`. Some of the business logic, mostly validation will be implemented in `predicate`\n",

Make sure that there's no overlapping `predicates`, i.e. one set of `input` will only satisfy one `predicate`. Otherwise, you have to ensure the order of `predicates` is appropriate for your need.
