    "1. Application has following attributes:\n",
    "  - `General information`, such as application's owner info, terms, etc.\n",
    "  - `Signatures`, a set of signatures of owners', witness, etc.\n",
    "  - `Expiry Date`, when application to be expired\n",
    "  - `Payment info`, info relating to payment process\n",
    "  - `Underwriting info`, info relating to underwriting process\n",
    "2. Possible actions:\n",
    "  - `update`, update `general information` of the application\n",
    "  - `sign`, sign the application, update `Signatures`\n",
    "  - `underwriting`, send the application through underwriting process\n",
    "  - `pay`, send the application through payment process\n",
